Think of me as a flower\
a flower that blooms every season,\
that has a majestic depth of bouquet\
a flower so everlasting it stays\
in your eyes if beheld with passion\
a flower as waxy and true as jasmine\
that would tie to the locks of your hair

Think of me as the moon.\
I will save you from the scorching sun,\
from the burns and its riddling brightness.\
No, not like a waning moon, that is frightened\
of dark clouds, and won't stay in your eyes.\
But like the blue moon wrapped in sacred halo\
whose light would kiss your face and immerse.
