The spring sky is pastel-colored in gradient sunset.\
I miss the clouds, some flew past in impetuous,\
the rays lancing through as if hurled by a warrior.\
The air, calm and crimson, storms pictures of you—\
laid back in retention; I wish you could see the lava\
brim up my eyes and burn down my face, my love.

Trails on my face, a wistful smile, a tearful retrospection\
of last spring, of the white iris clipped into your hair,\
the breeze tending to your skin like to the sea it must—\
hefting waves; I recollect the beach, us lying like sand castles,\
your hand in mine, tiny fingers pressing, lips drawing close.\
Would that kiss be the only picture in my memory, my love?

A robin in my sight sings, I wonder what the melodies mean.\
My body used to be as musical, but ever since it’s hollow—\
the noon I let loose your hand, the evening your sun set over me.\
The waning moon, crowning darkness, odour of melted candles,\
all incite guilt and disgust that my apologies are long overdue.\
Had this spring not been more cheerful to my heart, my love?
