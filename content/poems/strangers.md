I saw you today after the rain washed away\
as you waded across the pavement under the evening\
as you stepped past me lacerating the frosty air

Slight freckles around your crimson nose\
like those spots on the moon, dark but beautiful,\
hair that lay on your shoulder fluttering gently

your eyes concealed and unwilling to look\
your hands withdrawn and clutching onto each other\
I wonder if you noticed me or if your eyes felt reluctant

You appear different than you were in December\
vigor and solemnity bound to your countenance\
doubt and distress emanating underneath your skin

Daunted that we crumbled into silt so painlessly\
but I longed to have you engraved upon my skin\
your lips, fingers, body that once belonged to me
