There lived a man on a deserted island, far too impossible to reach. This man had nothing to admire in his life. How could he ever have? There's literally nothing on the island, except for tall trees and squirrels that run over them.

One sunny day while trying to catch some fish, he sees a sailor passing by. Apart from his own reflection in the water, this was the only time he had ever seen a face. Caught up in the moment, he ponders over the sailor's beauty.

He waves at her. She docks her boat and waves back. He proposes her of taking a break at the island, so he can cherish having a guest for the first time. The sailor agrees.

This man had lived in isolation for as long as he can remember. Thus, having a companion on the island is somewhat unusual for him. Unusual things are scary initially. They get beautiful by time, only if they are not actually scary.

He is still uncertain of why he stopped the sailor. Probably the sailor was not in need of a break, or maybe in a hurry, or could be that she was only one step away from her long aspired destination. Stopping by the island could have brought any unexpected turn in her journey. However, the fact stands, she chose to stop by and become his guest.

The man gets on speculating as to what made him stop the sailor. Probably, he was glad he did. Though unsure of how she perceived of his welcoming.

As much as the sailor's stay prolongs, he unconsciously bonds with her. Bringing her some tunas, making fire and cooking it over, picking coconuts for her thirst; making shadow for her to rest under.

For such a man residing in a deserted island, having another companion for the first time, how would one expect him to react?

As soon as the sailor discloses her mood of departure the next morning, he grows vulnerable. Maybe the sailor will abandon him and the island. Or maybe she will take him along. Who knows.

For now, they are still on the island. Talking, by the bonfire.
