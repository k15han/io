In an epoch of abhorrence and hostility, love was born somewhere. It flourished like a flower, blossomed slowly and sincerely, but in the weather of terror, it withered away. 
 
Past rhythmic march sessions of the military, vandalised walls, graffiti displaying rage, posters detailing the recent terror attacks; Sana walked along the pavement towards the subway shaking her head in despair. 
  
‘ How can human killing human be of any good? ’ thoughts breezed into her mind. 
 
Only a handful of commuters took the subway to work at the daybreak. Sana was one, but hers was a different destination. She boarded the subway uptown that carried a considerable crowd, pushed through and searched for a seat. Failed to find one, she thought of standing throughout the journey. Frowns veiled her face. 
 
'Have my seat,' came a gentle voice. 
 
'Oh, thank you!' the offer was accepted greedily. 

With a sigh of relief, she sank into the seat. 

The man nodded generously and walked away. It went unnoticed. 
 
Wheels screeched as the train came to the stop. Sana exited the subway station ebbing the feelings of insecurity about being stalked by the man who had offered her his seat. She had noticed him earlier during the journey, staring constantly. 
 
The park, an enclosed wilderness, attracted peace-lovers and seekers of inspiration, who were a few. It was a stretch of pavement&nbsp;from the subway. 
  
Upon reaching there, Sana stood aghast at the sight of the same man. He seemed unaware of the happenings, absorbed staring deep into a blank canvas unfurled over his thighs. She, however, disregarded and strode away to a faraway bench. Later, the day died virgin. 
 
The other day, they shared a bench in the park. 
 
'Are you following me?' anxiety compelled her. 
 
'I don't know you. Why would I?' he replied nonchalantly. 
 
Then he rolled his canvas, quietly stood and left. Sana gasped in amazement. Later, the red sun drowned in the vast horizon. 
 
It so happened that they met at an unexpectedly common place of interest. Inspiration was sought and so was peace felt profoundly. Further his fate and her doubt sowed the seeds of love. Still strange to each other, still unplanned, they met in the park every morning. Things developed between them smoothly and speedily, and with no resistance from either side . 
 
'May I have a seat?' came the gentle voice. The reply had an affirmative expression. He sat, took out the&nbsp;blank, dusty canvas and thought awhile. 'I come here for peace...' 'I seek inspiration here,' he interrupted, 'so I could paint something unimaginable, something that'd redefine beauty. Basically, I’m yet another struggling artist.' 
 
Sana gazed at the blank canvas he held. 
 
'I have been coming here for months. Never saw you before?' 'I used to sit at the other side', was his answer. 'And then suddenly?' 'I realized, that side had no beauty.' 'That is why your canvas is blank', she exclaimed foolishly. 'So was my life’, followed a pause. ‘But this side has great certainty, and my brushes seem ready.’ 
 
Later, the weary clouds thundered a yawn and poured heavily. 
 
A curiosity to learn him more and the overflowing anxiety seized her sleep. Nights prolonged indefinitely for her. She cursed the circumstances, and the thousand questions disquieting her mind. 
 
A bunch of orangish aurora aroused the land out of its torpor. With that, the mundane daily hustle commenced. That morning spring had pervaded the sky, and below in the park the two rejoiced. 
 
‘I guess your painting is ready’, her eyes fondly met his. ‘Not yet. Only the outline.’  Such a gentle voice I have never come across , she thought. Both smiled. 
 
‘What is your name?’ ‘Nor do I know yours,’ he inhaled, ‘but we shall eventually come to.’ Sana threw a quizzical look and decidedly kept quiet. 
 
‘We know each other more than names, don’t we?’ ‘Yes, we do’, she sighed. 
 
Then coquettishly slid her hand over his broad shoulder and gave a warm smile. ‘What is it?’ For moments their heavy breaths were heard. ‘Beauty maybe’, she held hers. They leaned, swooned by love, and kissed. 
 
Later, the slyly peeping moon appeared in the bluish firmament. 
 
So much soaked in the reminiscences of the gentle-voiced man, Sana’s augmented anticipation stiffened her patience.&nbsp; She pondered over the role this character had to play in the story of her life. She could only but turn over in bed impatiently and despise such desolate nights. 
 
A greyish tinge of disturbances had diffused the air, a growing mob of angry and anguished demonstrators had jammed the road, and the miserably outnumbered police gave it for the reason. A mass terrorist attack had taken thousands of lives, Sana learnt from a poster. Disgust gushed into her brain like piping-hot water. She stamped in contempt and strode away furiously. 
 
She took the metro, reached the park and sat on the bench waiting. A weird nervousness had crept into her soul; since it never happened that she arrived first. Half an hour later, it grew intense. Her face distorted and tears brimmed up her eyes. 
 
Just then, an old woman with short and tawny hair appeared and sat beside her. 
 
‘Indeed, you are astoundingly gorgeous’, rubbing her trembly highs out of cold. Baffled, Sana looked at the old woman. ‘But this piece of art, you ought to see, is much more’, handing over a rolled, red-ribbon-tied canvas. Sana unfolded it with an irresistible impulse. It was a portrait of her smiling under an orangish sky that flowed into shades of green and black downwards.  Was this the inspiration he was seeking for?  she thought. 
 
‘Last night, he was shot in the terrorist attack,’ began the old woman, gulping down a sob, ‘thrice...and succumbed to the injury.’ Sana turned at her. ‘He kept talking about you like a child since the day he saw you. And today, he had planned to come with a ring. For you gave him the reason to live, you gave inspiration to an artist, he was not at ease before’, her wrinkled face contracted to purplish-blue. 
 
‘Who are you?’ ‘His...unfortunate...mother...’ 
 
Later, the sorry sky shed tears and thundered tantrums. 
 
A thousand innocent lives, a mother’s support, a lover’s happiness; this way so got trampled under the feet of terrorism. The cause was a mere political achievement and an outraged religious crusade.
