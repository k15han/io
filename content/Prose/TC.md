Once an early winter morning, the sun ambushed behind thick clouds like a witty guerrilla, a fine mist hung in the air and had gradually begun shrouding the uncrowded railway station. Stray dogs wandered around the railway platform aimlessly, the hawkers peddled from passenger-to-passenger selling unappealing goods, railwaymen disembarked parcels from the freight wagon that had arrived at the other side, as a steam-engine train coughing an expanse of smoke all along the way blared in. Screeching of wheels and the hum of voices took the situation in quick succession as the train sluggishly parked over.

Passengers detrained in a rush; the last one to step out was a girl in her early teens, immensely elated upon arrival. Behind emerged her father clothed in a long brown coat and a Stetson hat, holding her by the hand.

"Papa, that cascade isn't far away from here. It's just a walk of ten minutes", she began as they walked towards the exit.

The father smiled brusquely as he lit a cigarette. The loss of his beloved wife in a fateful accident long ago had gripped him tight in despair. His unshaven face flashed colourless expressions, staggering steps troubled him walking, and a fatigued soul disclosed the fact that he had had enough with his life. And Sara could see it all.

They had hired a cart and it took less than ten minutes to arrive. Sara dragged her father through a pathway naturally fenced by springing twigs, towards the cascade. As they walked, splashes of water against stones were soon audible; behind the foliage the scenery then disclosed itself. They perched upon a nearby rock and beheld the phenomenal wonders of the creek.

‘What is that you like so much about it?’ interrogated the father in an utterly dull voice.

‘Its stubbornness to keep flowing’, she answered, ‘But I guess, one day, it might stop. Like you stopped living.’

The dusty warehouse smelt of hot iron. A heap of tools and pieces of machinery lay down on the floor. In a corner, with a machinist's paraphernalia, sat an old man welding metal. Soaked up in work, he did not notice the lady who had walked in.

'Papa, I'm home', until she shouted. Immediately he cut off, removed the welding helmet and sprang up in joy.

'Sara', he uttered a cry, gazing at her with moist eyes.

'Your sleeves are stained', she discovered as they walked out.

Sara tried stifling the sorrows flooding over her face. The contracted brows, torn eyes, crimsoned nose, irregular grin, however, were uncontrollable together.

Just as the old man caught the sight of her daughter's grief a thousand questions brimmed up his mind.

'What went wrong? Where's John?' he enquired the basic ones first.

'John has gone,' she bawled.

'Where?'

'Out of my life. We divorced', sobs followed.

The old man was conscious of the adversities perturbing her marriage life. Additionally, her beliefs about John's extra-marital amour turned out to be factual. Thus, he decidedly kept her daughter back.

As clocks paced, Sara flung herself abysmally into depression. Daylong agony sickened her soul and toughened her apathy in life. Like an ailing, she only slept, rarely talked and ate. This sluggish disposition of Sara worried the old man. He sought a doctor, but neither of the prescriptions helped.

So one foggy morning, in his rusty van, they drove past hills and grassy ridges. Sara stared out of the lively window, still soaked in the dullness. The van halted beside a course carpeted upon by dew.

'Where are we?' she asked.

'Come on.'

They walked in, soon splashes of water were audible. Upon reaching, they sat on a rock.

'What now?' she asked annoyingly.

'Behold the flow of water.'

'Yeah, so?'

'Twenty years ago you brought me here while I was in despair of your mother's loss. You told that one day it won't flow anymore, like me. Thence I started living afresh, and it's still flowing!', taking a glimpse of his daughter, 'However, I'm doubtful now. It may certainly cease flowing, since my daughter has stopped living.'

Sara pondered over. Then a grin slid across her face.

Just as they were about to leave she exclaimed, 'Such a fool have I been! It won't stop. Neither will I.'

The old man nodded with a smile. Sara smiled back.

The rippling sound soon muffled and then gradually became inaudible.
